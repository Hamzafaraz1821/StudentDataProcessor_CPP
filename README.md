# StudentDataProcessor_CPP
 This repository contains the source code for a C++ application developed as a second semester Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project. The application is designed to read, process, and analyze student and course data from multiple text files.   The data includes student details, course details, and other related information. The application handles missing or null data, calculates various statistics related to the data, and writes the processed data to new text files.   The project demonstrates the use of various OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. It also showcases the use of C++ Standard Library features such as vectors and file I/O operations.   This project serves as a practical implementation of OOP principles in a real-world scenario, providing valuable insights into data processing and analysis.
